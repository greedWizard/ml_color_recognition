# ml_color_recognition
I'm new to ML so I decided to start my "career" :D by writing a simple app using the kns algorithm which I made from scratch. 
Based on the color.data file the machine can recognise about 10 colors and interpret it with the colors.val file. 
Also if you want to you can check it by using the 
GUI app or from the console by openning test_inputs.py in the algs folder.
